This project is a Customer Churn Prediction System built using Machine Learning and Streamlit.
It analyzes customer data to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) or stay, helping businesses take proactive retention measures.

The model is trained using the Telco Customer Churn Dataset and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
